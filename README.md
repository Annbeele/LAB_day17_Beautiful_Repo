### Scenario
We are risk analysis consultants trying to give valuable advice to the bank's director. The bank stores information about the clients, including accounts held, transactions over the last few months, loans granted, cards issued, etc.

### Previous milestones
We already managed to:
- Identify the **good clients**, to whom we can offer other services
- Identify the **bad clients**, that we have to watch carefully to minimize the losses

### Next step
Can we build a machine learning model that predicts if a customer is more likely to become a bad or good one?
